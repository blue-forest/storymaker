# StoryMaker

This project written in Rust is a game with the ability to automatically generate a world, characters and quests. For now there is not yet interactive gameplay, but you can already generate a world and see the generated data in the console.

Currently I am working on this in my extra time and there is no playable version yet. Feel free to start a dialogue with me in [Discussions](https://github.com/n4zim/storymaker/discussions) or by giving your opinion on the potential evolutions of the game.
